# *Cross-lingual gender prediction*
[Master Thesis](/files/projects/MA_thesis_WT_final){: .btn--research} \
In my master thesis I used Transformer models to add additional information to a German written dialect corpus.\
Leveraging these systems I showed how to collect new dialect data on Twitter. \
Moreover, I performed socio-linguistic analyses demonstrating how socio-demographic factors influence dialectality.

# *Cross-lingual gender prediction*
[Project Paper](/files/projects/xlingual_gender_pred_WT.pdf){: .btn--research} \
In this project two classification systems for gender prediction across different languages were implemented. \
One system was based on linguistic features the other on a LLM (XLM-RoBERTa). \
Leveraging these systems we tried to predict the gender of Twitter users from their tweets.

# *Plutchik Vectors for Emotion Classification*
[Project Paper](/files/projects/emotion_tuning_word_embeddings_WT.pdf){: .btn--research} \
Building on Plutchik's model of emotions I created a task-specific optimization function.\
This allowed for emotion-tuning of word embeddings during training.\
The project aimed for improving performance of an emotion classification task on the AffectiveText corpus.

# *Speech enhancement with an LMS adaptive filter*
[Project Paper](/files/projects/echo_cancellation_WT.pdf){: .btn--research} \
In this project I implemented a simple Least Mean Squares adaptive filter. \
Its effectiveness was tested in an echo cancellation scenario.
