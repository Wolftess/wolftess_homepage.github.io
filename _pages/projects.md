# *Plutchik Vectors for Emotion Classification* 
Building on Plutchik's model of emotions I created a task-specific optimization function.\
This allowed for emotion-tuning of word embeddings during training.\
The project aimed for improving performance of an emotion classification task on the AffectiveText corpus.
