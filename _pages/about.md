I completed a B.A. in Linguistics at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/), followed by an M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics at the [Institute of Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) in Stuttgart. 

My focus lies on automated natural language analysis, computational dialectology and Machine Learning for NLP.
